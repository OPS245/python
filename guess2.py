# Purpose: Demonstrate for loops and lists (arrays)
# Usage: ./guess2.py

## Updates from guess2:
# - Added a counter for the number of attempts, tell the user this upon correct guess
# - Generate secret as a random number

# Import the random and sys modules

# Initialize a variable called secret with a number to guess

# Intialize guess

# Create a variable to store the number of tries

# While guess is not equal to secret

	# Increment tries

	# Prompt the user again, store the value in guess

	# if guess is less than secret
		
		# Tell the user their guess is too low

	# else if guess is greater than secret

		# Tell the user their guess is too high

	# else if guess equals secret
		
		# Tell the user they guessed correctly
		
		# Exit with a zero status code

	# If tries equals 20
		
		# Exit with an error telling the user they have guessed incorrectly 20 times
